# Vision Statement

According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, **85%** of college students have felt overwhelmed by everything they need to balance. These feelings can lead to, or increase, levels of _anxiety_ and _depression_ in students. Often times these students do not feel comfortable revealing their identity. This is why we want to be able to serve the community here at **Calvin University** by providing a free app that connects students to counselors with an option of connecting to the counselors anonymously. 

With their student IDâ€™s, Calvin students will have the option to seek counseling from certified counselors for free, and have the benefit of remaining anonymous if they so desire.
